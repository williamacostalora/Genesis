        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Â¡Hola! My name is Profesora Garcia. I am a passionate Spanish tutor with over 7 years of experience in teaching Spanish to students of all levels and backgrounds.</p>
            <p>My teaching approach focuses on making learning Spanish fun, interactive, and tailored to each student's needs and learning style. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to refine your language skills, I'm here to help you achieve your language goals.</p>
            <p>When I'm not teaching, you can find me exploring new cultures, trying out new recipes, or enjoying the great outdoors. I am from Venezuela, but I have made Louisiana my home since 2009. I am a mother of three beautiful girls. I hold a master's degree in Leadership and Education from the University of Louisiana at Monroe. I have taught at various learning levels from Elementary to High School.</p>
